## BLAH7 project description

The goal of this project is to enable the analysis of COVID-19 related scientific literature by enriching it with domain specific entities.
We have automatically processed the entire [LitCovid](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/) corpus with our [OGER](https://nlp.idsia.ch/TOOLS/OGER/) pipeline.

Our terminologies are derived from the major life science databases using our [Bio Term Hub](https://pub.cl.uzh.ch/projects/ontogene/biotermhub/), which allows us to maintain up-to-date dictionaries synchronized with the original resources.

Our current annotation pipeline generates annotations for several entity types:

- cell lines
- clinical drugs (RxNorm)
- cells
- molecular processes
- sequences
- organ/tissue
- chemicals
- Gene Ontology (GO)
- organisms
- proteins
