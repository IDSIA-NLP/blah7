## Subtask 2: Find evidence in support or against specific drugs for the treatment of COVID-19

The goal of this subtask is to **find evidence in support or against specific drugs for the treatment of COVID-19**
within the OGER-annotated LitCovid dataset (both the abstract dataset and the full text dataset can be used).

The following drugs in particular will be considered: [hydroxychloroquine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxychloroquine), [remdesivir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remdesivir), [avigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favipiravir).

Examples of statements in support/against the clinical usage of Hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19:

[32150618](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32150618/): *Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.*

[32205204](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32205204/): *Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been found to be efficient on SARS-CoV-2, and reported to be efficient in Chinese COV-19 patients.*
*Despite its small sample size our survey shows that hydroxychloroquine treatment is significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin.*

[32240719](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32240719/): *No evidence of rapid antiviral clearance or clinical benefit with the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in patients with severe COVID-19 infection.*

It is suggested that the participants use OGER annotation to detect occurrences of the drugs, and then identify the sentences containing such mentions. Ideally, a process of classification should be implemented which classify such sentences as in support or against the usage of the drug.
